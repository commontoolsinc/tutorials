  In this section, we will add on to the simple state we created in the last
  section. We will use user input to modify the existing state.

# Modifying State

## TODO
* Modify existing state
  * user input button rolling dice
  * DONE text input changing name
* more complex state types (object)
  * make stats an objects
* How to derive from two state inputs
* How to read a value

## Introduction

In the last section, we learned how to create state via `Cell`s and also
how to create derived states.
We used building a fantasy game character sheet as an example.
We'll continue with that to learn how to modify state.

## Handling User Input

Let's start with changing our character's name.
We'll need to add a text input field in the `[UI]` section.
We can't just use regular HTML components.
The Common Tools runtime has its own JSX components to
to make sure data is protected and not accessed by
other scripts.

```{code-block} typescript
:label: state_ac_lift
:linenos: false
:emphasize-lines: 
    <common-send-message
      name="Update"
      placeholder="Update Name"
      // we need to fill out the event listener attribute below
      // onmessagesend= 
    />
```

If you deploy this update, you'll see an input field, but nothing happens
when you enter data. As the comments indicate, we
need to fill out code for the onmessagesend JSX event listener.

This is when we learn about `handler`.
A `handler` is a Common Tools runtime component that, like its name
suggests, handles events.
The JSX event listener (such as `onmessagesend` in our code) will call
our handler to handle the event emitted by the JSX component.

## Understanding Handlers

Handlers in Common Tools have a specific signature:

```{code-block} typescript
handler<EventType, ArgsType>(handlerFunction)
```

The `handler` function takes:
- Two **type** parameters:
  - `EventType`: defines the event data structure
  - `ArgsType`: defines the arguments/context that you want to pass to the handler
- One **argument**: we pass in a function which receives:
  - `event` (matches EventType) as its first parameter
  - `args` (matches ArgsType) as its second parameter

:::{admonition} Advanced note
The `handler` function returns a factory that you call with your actual arguments to create the event handler. This factory pattern allows the handler to bind specific values from your recipe while still receiving events from the UI components.
:::

We'll start by writing our handler which takes the event emitted by the
`<common-send-message>` component. This component emits a CustomEvent with the structure `{detail: {message: string}}`,
where `message` contains the text the user entered.
The handler will also take in the
`characterName` cell. It will simply set the cell with the new name
from the event.

### Creating the Handler

```{code-block} typescript
:label: state_handler_updatename
:linenos: false
:emphasize-lines:
const updateName = handler<
  { detail: { message: string } },
  { characterName: Cell<string> }
>(
  (event, { characterName }) => {
    console.log("Updating character name to:", event.detail.message);
    characterName.set(event.detail.message);
  }
);
```
Note that `characterName` was passed in as a `Cell`. We created it via the
`cell()` function, which returns us a `Cell`. It's important to
mark reactive components as `Cell` so that we can call methods such
as `set()` on them.

Now we can attach this handler to our input component:

```{code-block} typescript
:label: state_handler_attach
:linenos: false
:emphasize-lines:
<common-send-message
  name="Update"
  placeholder="Update Name"
  onmessagesend={updateName({ characterName })}
/>
```

If you deploy this code, you should see something like:

:animate: fade-in

```{literalinclude} ./code/state_02.tsx
:language: typescript
```
:::

Et voilà ! We've fully implemented modifying state though user input.

:::{admonition} Important!
Notice that if you reload the page, or even load the same URL on a different
browser, you'll see the saved data for your character's name.
This is because cells are persistent by default.
:::

:::{admonition} Advanced note
Each cell is created with a `cause`, this uniquely identifies.
We carefully construct this `cause` so that it remains the same
each time a recipe is run, but also unique from other cells created.
